# Fog-of-War Experiment: Swift & Metal 🌫️👨‍💻

Welcome to my Fog-of-War Experiment Repository! This is a fun, challenging, and experimental project where I'm playing with the idea of adding a fog-of-war effect to real-world maps using Swift and the Metal framework. Think of it as a technical playground for map enthusiasts!

## Why This Project? 🤔🚀

The main goal here is FUN! 🎉 I'm curious to see how I can overlay a dynamic fog-of-war effect on top of actual maps (like Apple Maps or Google Maps). It's a technical challenge, a learning opportunity, and a chance to experiment with something new and exciting.

## What I'm Doing 🛠️

- **Fog-of-War Effect:** Creating a fog layer that covers the map and dissipates based on user movement.
- **Swift & Xcode:** The project is built using Swift, leveraging Xcode for development.
- **Metal Framework:** Utilizing the Metal framework to render the fog effect, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in terms of graphics.

## How to Get Involved 🌟
